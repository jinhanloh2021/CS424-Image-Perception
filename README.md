# SMU Logo bounding box detection
Design an algorithm to identify all images of SMU from a set of random images. A bounding box should be drawn around the SMU logo whenever it appears in an image.

When an SMU logo occurs in an image, a bounding box should be drawn around it. Logo identification will be evaluated by its F1 score.

## Setup
Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
Add the environment variables in a `.env` file. Adjust the train settings based on your GPU specifications.

## Run
Run the jupyter notebook.
